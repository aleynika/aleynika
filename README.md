# 🌿 Aleynika — Data, Ethics & Storytelling  

> “Between numbers and narratives lies the space where history breathes again.”  

Hello — I’m **Aleynika**, a data analyst and researcher focused on how information shapes understanding, policy, and memory.  
My work combines **data analytics**, **digital humanities**, and **public health**, with a particular interest in **U.S. maternal mortality trends** and the **preservation of objective data** in the age of generative AI.  

---

## 💼 About Me  
I bridge analytical precision with cultural and ethical awareness.  
I approach every dataset — whether a public health report or a digital archive — as both evidence and story.  
My goal is to use data not just to describe systems, but to help improve them.

## 🔍 Focus Areas  
- **U.S. Maternal Mortality Research** — independent, data-driven analysis of health outcomes using federal and state datasets  
- **Digital Humanities** — transforming historical and cultural collections into structured, interpretable data  
- **Data Ethics & Preservation** — protecting the integrity of factual, human-generated datasets amid generative AI expansion  
- **Analytical Storytelling** — developing visual dashboards and reproducible workflows that make data both transparent and engaging
