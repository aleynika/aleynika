# 🌿 Aleynika — Data, Ethics & Storytelling  

> “Between numbers and narratives lies the space where history breathes again.”  

Hello — I’m **Aleynika**, a data analyst and researcher focused on how information shapes understanding, policy, and memory.  
My work connects **data analytics**, **digital humanities**, and **public health**, with a particular focus on **U.S. maternal mortality trends** and the **preservation of objective data** in the age of generative AI.

## 💼 About Me  
I bridge analytical precision with cultural and ethical awareness.  
I approach every dataset — whether a public health record or a digital archive — as both **evidence and story**.  
My goal is to use data not just to describe systems, but to help improve them.

## 🪞 Research Philosophy  
I believe **data has memory** — and preserving its accuracy is a form of stewardship.  
In an age when algorithms can rewrite or obscure truth, I strive to make my analyses **transparent, verifiable, and human-centered**.  

> *“Preservation begins with attention — and data, at its best, is a form of attention.”*
