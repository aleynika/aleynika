# 🕯️ Aleynika — Data, Memory & Meaning  

> “Between numbers and narratives lies the space where history breathes again.”  

Hello — I’m **Aleynika**, a researcher and data analyst specializing in **digital humanities**, **archival organization**, and **data ethics**.  
My work focuses on how we preserve and interpret historical data in an era increasingly shaped by automation and generative systems.  

I’m passionate about designing **structured, transparent datasets** for art, history, and cultural institutions — ensuring that stories, artworks, and artifacts remain both **discoverable and authentic**.

## 🏛️ About My Work  

I work at the intersection of **data analysis** and **human memory** — transforming archives and collections into accessible, meaningful structures.  
I believe organizing information is an act of preservation — one that gives the past a stable voice in the digital present.

## 🪞 Research Philosophy  
I believe that every dataset is a fragment of memory — and that preserving its accuracy is a form of care.  
As AI systems increasingly reinterpret our records, maintaining factual, transparent data becomes a cultural responsibility.
